## Abstract

Emission is currently close to 6 Quanta per minute and will be exponentially reduced to 0 in aproximately 200 years. Reducing the emission to 2 Quanta per minute will reduce the availability of Quanta.

## Motivation

Lower emission rate will most likely increase demand of Quanta, the price, and people who are willing to point their mining rigs to qrl which will enlarge the network.

## Specification

To be determined by team if accepted.

## Backward compatibility

Changing the emission is a hard fork upgrade? 

## Implementation

To be determined by team if accepted.
