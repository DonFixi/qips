## Abstract

[RandomX](https://github.com/tevador/RandomX) is a proof-of-work algorithm that aims to achieve longer-term ASIC resistance than the current CryptoNight-based tweaks.
It will be used in the Monero blockchain after their next upgrade. It has been [audited](https://ostif.org/four-audits-of-randomx-for-monero-and-arweave-have-been-completed-results/) by the people (x41) who audited the QRL cryptography.

From [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/aovypq/randomx_asic_resistant_pow_community_feedback/) announcing it: "RandomX is a proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm that is optimized for general-purpose CPUs. RandomX uses random code execution (hence the name) together with several memory-hard techniques to minimize the efficiency advantage of specialized hardware."

## Motivation

A mining algorithm change would go a long way towards re-vitalizing the QRL mining community. Many people built rigs or pointed rigs at QRL initially but have seen their returns crushed by ASICs and FPGAs, and therefore no longer participate. The long term health of the network will be increased if mining rewards are being paid to community members, and it will create another way for people to get involved in QRL.

## Specification

To be determined by team if accepted.

## Backward compatibility

Changing the mining algorithm is a hard fork upgrade. 

## Implementation

To be determined by team if accepted.
